Perfect by Ed Sheeran
[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

Hahahahaha
Tank God
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin': "Rest in peace to Bon Scott" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas

Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow)

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar (21, 21, 21)
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra (Bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, "¡No más!" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They like, "Savage, why you got a 12 car garage
And you only got six cars?" (21)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (Kiss that?)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (Big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (Old racks)
L.A. bitches always askin', "Where the coke at?" (21, 21)
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar (Ayy)

[Chorus: Post Malone & 21 Savage]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi

Thunder by Imagine Dragons
[Verse 1]
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes, sir," not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning and the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning and the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

[Verse 2]
Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, "You're basic," they say, "You're easy"
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning and the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning and the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

[Bridge]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)

[Outro]
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
(Woah-oh-ohh)
Thunder, thunder, thun-

Too Good At Goodbyes by Sam Smith
[Verse 1]
You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Verse 2]
I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less l love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry
(No way that you'll see me cry)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Bridge]
No
No, no, no, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you'll see me cry)
Ahhh
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Outro]
'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
All I Want For Christmas Is You by Mariah Carey
[Intro]
I-I-I don't want a lot for Christmas

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

There upon the fireplace (I)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just going to keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (I)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Oh, oh, oh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh)
And everyone is singing (Oh, yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Yeah, oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?, yeah

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh, I just want you for my own (ooh)
More than you could ever know (oh, oh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is...

[Outro]
You
You, baby all I want for Christmas is you, baby
You
All, all, all, all I want for Christmas is you, baby
You
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
Bad At Love by Halsey
[Verse 1]
Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (Ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

[Verse 2]
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (Ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)

[Bridge]
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades
Each time the feeling fades
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades

[Chorus]
You know I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (Ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
Oh, oh
