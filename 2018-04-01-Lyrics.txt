[Intro]
And they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yuh

[Verse 1]
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

[Chorus]
God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't, yuh
I feel good, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't
I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed
Might go down a G.O.D., yeah, wait
I go hard on Southside G, yuh, wait
I make sure that north-side eat

[Post-Chorus]
And still, bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Bad things

They wishin' on me
Yuh, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2]
She say, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly
I only love my bed and my mama, I'm sorry"
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there'd be no me
'Magine if I never met the broskies

[Chorus]
God's plan, God's plan
I can't do this on my own, ayy, no, ayy
Someone watchin' this shit close, yep, close
I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy, road, ayy
Might go down as G.O.D., yeah, wait
I go hard on Southside G, ayy, wait
I make sure that north-side eat, yuh

[Post-Chorus]
And still, bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yeah, yeah
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yeah

Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go nowhere fast
Let's enjoy right here where we at

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha]
I don't mean to be so uptight
But my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie, ain't gon' lie
'Cause I'm tired of the fake love
Show me what you're made of
Boy, make me believe

Whoa, hold up girl, don't you know you're beautiful?
And it's easy to see

Psycho by Post Malone
[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (Hey)
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though
Perfect by Ed Sheeran
[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

The Middle by Zedd, Maren Morris & Grey
[Verse 1: Maren Morris]
Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

[Pre-Chorus: Maren Morris]
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

[Verse 2: Maren Morris]
Ohh, take a step
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still running, dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess? Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

[Pre-Chorus: Maren Morris]
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

[Bridge: Maren Morris]
Looking at you, I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless of my objection, oh, oh
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin
Just come over, pull me in, just

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Oh, baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle, no no
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh yeah, I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh, in the middle
Baby-y-y, why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, middle?

Yeah, it’s Freaky Friday
I’m in Chris Brown's body
I drive his Ferrari and I’m light-skinned black

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
(Ring ring) What the fuck?
I woke up and I'm Lil Dicky (Lil Dicky?)
Ugh, what the fuck?
This shit is real weak
How his dick staying perched up on his balls like that?
Walking down the street and ain’t nobody know my name (whoa)
Ain’t no paparazzi flashing pictures, this is great (whoa)
Ain’t nobody judging 'cause I’m black or my controversial past
I’ma go and see a movie and relax (woo)
Ayy, I’m a Blood but I can finally wear blue (cool)
Why his momma calling all the time?
Leave me the fuck alone, bitch
Wait, if I’m in Dicky’s body, Breezy is who?
Hope my daughter’s in school
Fuck, if I was Chris Brown, where would I be?
What would I do?

I’m in Chris Brown's body
I look at my soft dick with delight, it’s my dream dick

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky & Chris Brown]
If I was Lil Dicky in my body, where would I be?
I’m tryna to find myself like an introspective monk
I’m balling on the court, oh my god I can dunk
Snap a flick of my junk
My dick is trending on Twitter? Fuck
Now I’m at the club, I talked my way into getting in
I look up in the VIP, my goodness there I am
I signal to him to let me in but he won’t let me in
I don’t know who that is
Wait, who the fuck he think he is?
Took a glass bottle, shatter it on the bouncer's head (woo)
Walked up to that motherfucker
Wait, think it through for a sec
If you hurting me then you only hurting yourself
But wait, I love myself
That was the key, now we're switching back

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I woke up in Chris Brown’s body (oh yeah)
Somehow this shit turned into Freaky Friday
But we got no choice but to turn this bitch sideways
(I can't believe)
I can’t believe that it’s Freaky Friday

[Outro]
Lil Dicky: Wait, what the fuck?

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Havana, ooh na-na (hey)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (oh, yeah)
He took me back to East Atlanta, (ayy, ayy) na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana
My heart is in Havana (ayy)
Havana, ooh na-na

[Outro: Starrah, Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Uh huh
Oh, na-na-na (oh, na, yeah)
Oh, na-na-na
Oh, na-na-na (no, no, no, take me back)
Oh, na-na-na
Havana, ooh na-na
