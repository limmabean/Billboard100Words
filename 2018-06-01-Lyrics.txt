[Pre-Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
I keep lettin' you back in (You back in)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Drake]
Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
(Lil Weezyana shit)
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
(Murda on the beat)
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me
(A song for y'all to cut up to, you know?)
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me (Yeah)
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Everybody get your mothafuckin' roll on
I know shorty and she doesn't want no slow song
Had a man last year, life goes on
Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You've been inside, know you like to lay low
I've been peepin' what you bringin' to the table
Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for
First-last, phone bill, car note, cable
With your phone out, gotta hit them angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright (Alright!)
It's a short life, yeah

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me

Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?

[Refrain: Drake]

Without a follow, without a mention
You really pipin' up on these niggas
You gotta be nice for what to these niggas?

[Verse 2: Drake]
I understand, you got a hunnid bands
You got a baby Benz, you got some bad friends
High school pics, you was even bad then
You ain't stressin' off no lover in the past tense
You already had them
Work at 8 A.M., finish 'round five
Hoes talk down, you don't see 'em outside
Yeah, they don't really be the same offline
You know dark days, you know hard times
Doin' overtime for the last month
Saturday, call the girls, get 'em gassed up
Gotta hit the club, gotta make that ass jump
Gotta hit the club like you hit them mothafuckin' angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright (Alright!)
It's a short life

Gotta make that jump, gotta make that, gotta, gotta make that
Gotta, gotta, gotta g-g-gotta, g-g-gotta, gotta

I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me

Psycho by Post Malone
[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (Hey)
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though
The Middle by Zedd, Maren Morris & Grey
[Verse 1: Maren Morris]
Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

[Pre-Chorus: Maren Morris]
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

[Verse 2: Maren Morris]
Ohh, take a step
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still running, dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess? Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

[Pre-Chorus: Maren Morris]
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

[Bridge: Maren Morris]
Looking at you, I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless of my objection, oh, oh
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin
Just come over, pull me in, just

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Oh, baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle, no no
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh yeah, I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh, in the middle
Baby-y-y, why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, middle?
In the middle, middle
Yes Indeed by Lil Baby & Drake
[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Drake]
The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "Look up" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make 'em 'go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch I'm the baby

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"
Me and my dawg goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"
Me and my dawg goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate

[Outro: Future]
Wheezy outta here

Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go nowhere fast
Let's enjoy right here where we at

[Pre-Chorus 1: Florida Georgia Line]
Who knows where this road is supposed to lead?

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha]
I don't mean to be so uptight
But my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie, ain't gon' lie
'Cause I'm tired of the fake love
Show me what you're made of
Boy, make me believe

[Pre-Chorus 2: Florida Georgia Line]
Whoa, hold up girl, don't you know you're beautiful?
And it's easy to see

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Florida Georgia Line]

[Verse 2]
They point out the colors in you, I see 'em too
And, boy, I like 'em, I like 'em, I like 'em
We're way too fly to partake in all this hate
We out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Comin' out, even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now, can't stop, so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth, and if you don't know
Then now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah

[Chorus]
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (Oh yeah)
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
Oh, I just want you to come with me
We're on another mentality
Ain't got no tears left to cry (To cry)
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (Oh yeah)
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Comin' out, even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now (Hmm, oh)
Shut your mouth
Ain't got no tears left to cry
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I just want you to come with me
We're on another mentality
Ain't got no tears left to cry (Cry)
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (Oh yeah)
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up

[Refrain]
Pickin' it up, pickin' it up
Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up
Yeah, we turnin' it up
Fake Love by BTS
[방탄소년단의 FAKE LOVE 가사]

[Intro: V, Jungkook]
널 위해서라면 난
슬퍼도 기쁜 척 할 수가 있었어
널 위해서라면 난
아파도 강한 척 할 수가 있었어
사랑이 사랑만으로 완벽하길
내 모든 약점들은 다 숨겨지길
이뤄지지 않는 꿈속에서
피울 수 없는 꽃을 키웠어

[Hook: Jimin, Jin]
I'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love
I'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love

[Verse 1: RM, RM & Jungkook, J-Hope]
I wanna be a good man just for you
세상을 줬네 just for you
전부 바꿨어 just for you
Now I don't know me, who are you?
우리만의 숲 너는 없었어
내가 왔던 route 잊어버렸어
나도 내가 누구였는지도 잘 모르게 됐어
거울에다 지껄여봐 너는 대체 누구니

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
널 위해서라면 난
슬퍼도 기쁜 척 할 수가 있었어
널 위해서라면 난
아파도 강한 척 할 수가 있었어
사랑이 사랑만으로 완벽하길
내 모든 약점들은 다 숨겨지길
이뤄지지 않는 꿈속에서
피울 수 없는 꽃을 키웠어

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Love you so bad, love you so bad
널 위해 예쁜 거짓을 빚어내
Love it’s so mad, love it’s so mad
날 지워 너의 인형이 되려 해
Love you so bad, love you so bad
널 위해 예쁜 거짓을 빚어내
Love it’s so mad, love it’s so mad
날 지워 너의 인형이 되려 해

[Hook: Jimin, Jin]
I'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love
I'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love

[Verse 2: RM, Suga]
Why you sad? I don't know 난 몰라
웃어봐 사랑해 말해봐
나를 봐 나조차도 버린 나
너조차 이해할 수 없는 나
낯설다 하네
니가 좋아하던 나로 변한 내가
아니라 하네
예전에 니가 잘 알고 있던 내가
아니긴 뭐가 아냐 난 눈 멀었어
사랑은 뭐가 사랑 it's all fake love

[Bridge: Jimin, Jin]
(Woo) I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
(Woo) 나도 날 나도 날 잘 모르겠어
(Woo) I just know, I just know, I just know why
Cuz its all fake love, fake love, fake love

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Love you so bad, love you so bad
널 위해 예쁜 거짓을 빚어내
Love it’s so mad, love it’s so mad
날 지워 너의 인형이 되려 해
Love you so bad, love you so bad
널 위해 예쁜 거짓을 빚어내
Love it’s so mad, love it’s so mad
날 지워 너의 인형이 되려 해

[Hook: Jimin, Jin]
I'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love
I'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love

[Outro: Jimin/V, Jungkook/Jin]
널 위해서라면 난
슬퍼도 기쁜 척 할 수가 있었어
널 위해서라면 난
아파도 강한 척 할 수가 있었어
사랑이 사랑만으로 완벽하길
내 모든 약점들은 다 숨겨지길
이뤄지지 않는 꿈속에서
피울 수 없는 꽃을 키웠어
