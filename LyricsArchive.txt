Swae Lee:
Needless to say, I keep it in check
She was all bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck

Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check
She was all bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck

Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt

Ooh
Some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise
And I'm not tryna lose

Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower

Post Malone:
Every time I'm leavin' on ya
You don't make it easy, no
Wish I could be there for ya
Give me a reason to

Every time I'm walkin' out
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh

I know you're scared of the unknown
You don't wanna be alone
I know I always come and go
But it's out of my control

And you'll be left in the dust unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much
You'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower, yeah

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal

Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please, I do
What I want when I'm wanting to
My soul so cynical

Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type

Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal

Pity the men I know

Bad guy, bad guy

You good, T-Minus?

Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

Money in your palm don't make you real
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
Money in your palm don't make you real
==================================================================
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times I find myself longin'
For change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself longing
For change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in

Yeah, yeah

When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (yeah)
Oh no, your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know that we ride
Through the backstreets of a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how these ideas came to be
So baby, run away, away with me

Seventeen and we got a dream to have a family
A house and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly we turned twenty-three
Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Have old friends and know our enemies
Now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know where we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me
Singing

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now

He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

Mama said
Fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater
Go make a legacy
Manifest destiny
Back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Mama said
Burn your biographies
Rewrite your history
Light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, everyday
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Mama said don't give up
It's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love
And I'd hate to see you waiting

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

Mama said
It's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders
Ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties
Don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down

Mama said don't give up
It's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love
And I'd hate to see you waiting

They say it's all been done
But they haven't seen the best of me
So I got one more run
And it's gonna be a sight to see

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision

Every day that I'm alive, I'ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain't no way I'ma switch

Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down

Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

J. Cole
Break it on down, I break it on down
I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six hour drive, six and a half
Before I left I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
Yeah, two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like that

Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I'm aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I was never one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Ok, no problem, I'll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It's got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he sent me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot," I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
'Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest who did it
Before it all ends, nigga

His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die

==================================================================
I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide

And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake

You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

And my friend said
I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on

But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

And my friend said
I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay

It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go

But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay

It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go

It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly you're payin'?
Is the amount cleanin' you out, am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

Step on the glass, staple your tongue
Bury a friend, try to wake up
Cannibal class, killing the son
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive

That's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury your friend right now

For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs are froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

Step on the glass, staple your tongue
Bury a friend, try to wake up
Cannibal class, killing the son
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
==================================================================
Run that back, Turbo

You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em on it
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made

Yeah, every other night, another dollar gettin' made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young Gu-wunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (Too hard), charge it to the card (To the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the name
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave

Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made

Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh

Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
I've loved and I've lost

But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me

And I'm so good with that (so good with that)

She taught me love (love)
She taught me patience (patience)
And she handles pain (pain)
That shit's amazing (yeah, she's amazing)

One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama

Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid somethin' happens
Least this song is a smash (song is a smash)

I've got so much love (love)
Got so much patience (patience)
I've learned from the pain (pain)
I turned out amazing (turned out amazing)

I've loved and I've lost (yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (yeah, yeah)
Just look what I've found (yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I'll say

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose, you can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own

I could lie and say I like it like that
Like it like that
I could lie and say I like it like that
Like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend but keep me closer (call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own

And I could lie and say I like it like that
Like it like that
Yeah, I could lie and say I like it like that
Like it like that

But nothing is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own

I could lie and say I like it like that
Like it like that
I could lie and say I like it like that
Like it like that

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take
Another foreign or a bigger chain
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh
==================================================================
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the song of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am because I need to know

You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
And You say I am held when I am falling short
And when I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours
And I believe, oh I believe
What You say of me
I believe

The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You I find my worth, in You I find my identity, o-ooh

You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
And You say I am held when I am falling short
And when I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours
And I believe, oh I believe
What You say of me
Oh, I believe

Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure God, You have every victory, o-ooh

You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours
And I believe, oh I believe
What You say of me
I believe

Oh, I believe, yes I believe
What You say of me
I believe
==================================================================
If ever I get lost in your eyes tonight
Please just let me stay right there a little bit longer
Underneath the stars, we are on fire
And I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go

We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while
I'm telling you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight

I just wanna linger like this on your lips
And taste the salt air on your skin
Hold you in my hands
Anything and everything, you know that I'm all in

We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while
I'm telling you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight
Baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah
Let's just stay right here tonight

'Cause I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go

So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight

We've been to both Carolina's
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down the coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But I ain't got much memory of the scenes come to think
I miss them all every damn time
It's all your fault

No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
With my eyes on you

Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God I saw
All I needed too
Might as well have stayed in the room

No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
With my eyes on you

Don't you remember Times Square?
And people counting down everywhere
2000-whatever, no I didn't care
Cause baby you were there
And once again
Couldn't help but stare

No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you

Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah you guessed it girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you

Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
==================================================================
Remember the words you told me
Love me 'til the day I die
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own damn game

You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
Then I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

Lately our conversations
End like it's the last goodbye
Then one of us gets too drunk
And calls about a hundred times
So who you been calling, baby?
Nobody could take my place
When you looking at those strangers
Hope to God you see my face

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
Then I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
You're running around and I'm running away
Running away from you, mmm, from you

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
Then I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

I can still shut down a party
I can hang
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine

But when I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor in a sorority T-Shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila

I can kiss somebody brand new and not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory it only hits me this hard

When I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila

I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk
And I'm thinking
How I need your love, how I need your love
Yeah, it sinks in

When I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Sorority t-shirt, the same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
When I taste tequila

The way you light up any room, girl
You're what this world should be

Tomorrow, tonight, the rest of my life
I wanna be the man you want me to be
So stop right now, girl, tell me everything you need

Never leave 'I love you' left unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you

Poor me, pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell naw
I just want to sip till the pain wears off
Poor me, pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't ever hurt like this before

Don't wanna think about her

Wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

I'm gonna need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'm need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'm gonna be single
I'm need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
See the world through whiskey glasses

Last call
I swear this will be my last call
I ain't drunk dialing no more at 3am
Mr. Bartender hit me again

Don't wanna think about her
Wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'm need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'm gonna be single
I'm need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
See the world through whiskey glasses

Line 'em up x4
Knock 'em back x4
Fill 'em up x4
'Cause if she ain't ever coming back
Line 'em up x4
Knock 'em back x4
Fill 'em up x4
'Cause if she ain't ever coming back

I'm gonna need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'm need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'm gonna be single
I'm need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
See the world through whiskey glasses
==================================================================
I know it's a drag, I know it's a grind
I know that a dollar ain't worth a dime
Just trying to keep up with the Joneses at the end of the block
I know you get tired, I know you get down
I know you get sick of this soul sucking town
But let's make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got

'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet

Open sky, glimpse of heaven, take the top off the CJ-7
Let that surfside San Anne wind mess up your hair
And let that windshield frame the ocean
Radio keep coast-to-coastin'
If we don't get where we're going baby I don't care
I'm already there

'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet

Days will be long but the years will fly right by
We'll never be as young as we are tonight
Baby ain't that right, yeah

'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet
Life is short, make it sweet
Oh yeah
==================================================================
Man, what? (Haha)
This shit funny
I was like
Oof, this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, "You loved me first" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"

So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
"Flex on a ho every time they're insecure"
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past (Past)
I'm a whole different person (Person)
It's a gift and a curse (Curse)
But I cannot reverse it

You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it
==================================================================
I retired my red lipstick 'cause you said you didn't like it
I didn't wear my high heel shoes
'Cause I couldn't be taller than you
I didn't wanna lose my friends, but now it's hard to even find them
It's what you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

I thought I'd miss you (when it ended)
I thought it hurt me (but it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
I thought I'd miss you

But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
I miss me more
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)

I put on my old records that I hid in the back of the closet
And I turn them up to ten
And then I played them all again
I found my independence
Can't believe I ever lost it
What you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

I thought I'd miss you (when it ended)
I thought it hurt me (but it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you

But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)

I thought I'd miss you
I thought it hurt me
And I'd wanna kiss you
I thought I'd miss you

But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
And I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more
(I miss me more)
(I miss me more)
(I miss me more)
==================================================================
Baby, I don't feel so good
Six words you never understood
I'll never let you go
Five words you never say (aww)

I laugh alone like nothing's wrong
Four days have never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two is us
One slipped away

I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a twelve-step just for you?
Our conversations all in blue
Eleven heys (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Ten fingers tearing out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at seven, you were six minutes away (yay)

How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation

I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
==================================================================
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait till the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by

You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse
(I don't dream)

You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by

You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

Crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

You should see me in a crown
(You should see me, see me)
Your silence is my favorite sound
(You should see me, see me)
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one
==================================================================
When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine

Na, na, na, na, don't call me up
When you're looking at my photos
Getting hot, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Na, na, na, na

I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know it's sad that I changed, have a cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Na, na take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
But I'm here out in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

'Cause I'm here looking fine, babe
And I got eyes looking my way
And everybody's on my vibe, babe
Na, na, na, na don't call me up
My friends said you were a bad man
I should have listened to them back then
And now you're tryna hit me up again
Na, na, na, na

I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more

==================================================================
Girl you know I've know you forever
How many nights we hung out together
Same little crowd, little bar, little town
Round this old dance floor
My boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder
Making a motion like "'Could y'all get any closer?"
They wanna know what's up when I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over

There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true?
We make it true
Oh, we make it true

Well I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy
I can do whatever you want me to do, baby
Or you could lay one on me right now
We could really give them something to talk about

What d'you say we make it true, baby?

Oh be honest girl now
Do you want to do this or not?
Should we keep them talking, girl
Or should we just make them stop?

==================================================================
It's been a wreck me week
Sixty plus from dawn to dusk
In the red dirt heat
Busting it up for a couple of bucks
But it ain't no thing
Just another day till I'm on my way
To them cool, cool sheets and you and me

Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby

Gonna rock it right
No need to talk, I know what you want
And what you like
'Cause I do too, yeah
I love how you leave on the lights
Not a thing between you and me
And it feels so nice when you and I are

Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby

Yeah, yeah
It's been a wreck me week
Oh, but who needs sleep?

Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy

==================================================================
There's something in the way you roll your eyes
Takes me back to a better time
When I saw everything is good
But now you're the only thing that's good

Trying to stand up on my own two feet
This conversation ain't coming easily
And darling I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place

Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong going on outside

There's something in the way I wanna cry
That makes me think we'll make it out alive
So come on and show me how we're good
I think that we could do some good, mhm

Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong going on outside

Walk me home in the dead of night
'Cause I can't be alone with all that's on my mind
Say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong going on

Twenty four seconds, yeah, you better not stop
You got twenty four seconds, can you beat the shot clock
What, you're waitin' or look, daddy, I ain't got that much time
You seem anxious, you seem adamant but you ain't press my line
Wondering why, why, why (oh why)
Know you see ain't shy, shy, shy (oh why)
I'ma say bye, bye, bye, but I know I won't think twice (yeah)
Better let go of your pride (do-do)
Do it now (do-do), just do it now (do-do), oh yeah

When a nigga pull up on me, tell that nigga back, back
Don't you know all of these niggas wish that they could bag that

Five years of dating
Tired of being patient
What the fuck you're waiting for?
Yeah
It's a lot of niggas hating and I don't entertain 'em
But damn, you gotta give me more
Shhh, I know, I know and I'm really trying
Oh-oh, if you don't want it like me
I could think of about a hundred things I could be doing right now
Stop wasting my time with you, oh (do-do)
Okay, okay, since you gotta have it your way (do-do)

L, Love
Add "-rs" and that's surely what we are
Flip it 'round, add "-ve" and let's see if this goes far
Full of chuckles and cuddles and sometimes, eye puddles
Compose love like we're Mozart
==================================================================
Man, this shit's unflatterin', all up in my head again
I don't feel myself right now, maybe I should just lay down
If vanity's my vitamin, well, I don't feel the difference
I don't like myself right now, gotta find a way out

What you feel is natural
But I don't wanna feel this anymore
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor
What you waitin' for?

Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl

Draw your comparisons, tryin' to find who's lesser than
I don't wanna wear your crown, there's enough to go around

What you feel is natural (Natural)
You don't gotta put up with this anymore (Anymore)
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor (Oh)
Tell me what you waitin' for?

Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo

==================================================================
Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don't prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me darlin'
It's been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears
Integrity, faith and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise, tearin' at the seams
I wish I could escape it, I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I've been askin' for-
Oh, I've been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war, on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin' for- (Trust me, darlin')
Oh, I've been askin' for (Trust me, darlin') problems, problems, problems

So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise, tearin' at the seams
I wish I could escape it, I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

I can't breathe, I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be
Believe me, this one time
Believe me

I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

Please believe me
Please believe me
==================================================================
No, Billie, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There's a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn

Don't ask questions, you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin' to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya

Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michaels Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life

Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my believer 'cause I don't self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it

Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can't you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my as-king about my motto

You should enter in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?

You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

Did you like it? Did you like that?
Um, which part?
==================================================================
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared

Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share

I'm in their second hand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny now or ever

Can you check if you're breathing? Oh my god
(And it's like, wait, like, when?)

Wakin' up at sundown (ooh)
They're late to every party (ooh)
Nobody's ever sorry (ooh)
Too inebriated now to dance

Morning as they come down (come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (learning)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance

I'm in their second hand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny now or ever

Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake

What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doin' nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared

Come down
Hurting
Learning
==================================================================
I've been watching you
For some time
Can't stop staring
At those ocean eyes
Burning cities
And napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

I've been walking through
A world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature
Made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
==================================================================
Girl I know you had a long day
You ain't feelin' them downtown lights
But I got a bottle at your favorite place
Just waitin' for us in a bucket on ice

Damn, I didn't think it'd be that easy
'Cause now you're gettin' ready
I'm just sittin' there watchin' TV
Here you come lookin' like a grown man's dream
Damn, I can't believe, I can't believe

I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at the fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it

Yeah, as cool at it would be
Watchin' people wonder who you are
Oh, we should just say we did, we can start with a kiss
And pretend we just got back from the bar

I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at the fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it

Yeah, it's a little cold outside
The music's probably way too loud
To hear you laugh
And there's a look in your eyes
Looks like we ain't leavin' now
Girl, I'm so glad, I'm so glad

I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at the fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it
==================================================================
All my life, been hustling
And tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a hooker sellin' songs
And my pimp's a record label
This world if full demons, stocks and bible traitors
So I do the deed get up and leave
I climber and a sadist, yeah

Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't you ready for the latest?
Ain't got enough evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo

Hey look ma, I made it
Hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
If it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said hey look ma, I made it

Friends are happy for me
Or they're honey-suckle phonies
Then they celebrate my medals
Or they wanna take my trophies
Some are loyal soldiers
All the thrones are rosy
And if you never know who to trust
Then trust me you'll me lonely, oh

Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't you ready for the latest?
Ain't got enough evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo

Hey look ma, I made it
Hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
If it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said hey look ma, I made it, I made it
I said hey look ma, I made it, I made
I see it, I want it, I take it, take it
If it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me

I said hey look ma, I made it
(I'ma best believe it, I'ma best believe it)
Hey look ma, I made it
(Hey, you must be dreamin')
(I'ma best believe it, I'ma best believe it)
(Hey, you must be dreamin')
Hey look ma, I made it
(I'ma best believe it, I'ma best believe it)
(Hey, you must be dreamin')
Hey look ma, I made it

Way up in the mountains, four thousand feet high
There's a trail through the trees to a cliff where Carolina meets the sky
Oh, and there's a view I just can't describe
No, I'm not there yet, just a few more steps, baby wait
Okay, you can open your eyes
This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking about
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, this is it
Girl I know that you've been waiting and talking to your friends
Wondering if and wondering where and wondering when
Well I've been waiting too, holding on to this ring
For the right words to say, for the right time and place, for me to get on one knee
This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking about
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world here together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, well this is it
This is it
Now you're walking down the aisle
And I can't help but smile
This is it, this is now, it's what I've been talking about
Looking out, I can see forever
So take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
Surrounded by our family and our friends
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss
This is it
Yeah, This is it
==================================================================
Never knew my old man's truck could even run like that
Should've known better than to take that curve so fast
Daddy pulled up, I was down in a ditch
He asked me why I did what I did

There was this girl, drink in her hand
Shootin' me a "let's get into trouble" grin
I ain't never seen somethin' so fine
And I was doin' anything to make her mine
I was out of my mind, she was out of this world
There was this girl

Some folks ask me why I still pick this guitar
They say livin' that life on the road won't get you very far
I say man you should've been down in Tupelo
Seen what was in the front row

There was this girl, beer in her hand
Shootin' me a "play a little Skynyrd" grin
She's turnin' it up, she's turnin' me on
And I'd play her anything she'd sing along
I was out of my mind, she was out of this world
There was this girl
Yeah there was this girl

Didn't know a diamond ring could cost so much (damn)
Took six months on a farm 'fore I saved up
All my drinkin' buddies still out on the town
Wonderin' why I ever settled down

But there was this girl, holdin' my hand
Shootin' me a "start a life together" grin
She's pullin' me in, she's straightenin' me out
And now I know what love is all about
I'm still out of my mind, she's still out of this world
There was this girl

Yeah, there was this girl
Yeah, there was this girl
There was this girl

[Intro: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh

[Refrain: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 2: Lil Nas X]
Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road

I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Verse 3: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Outro: Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

Всичко ми е любопитно, как мина деня ти?
О, кажи ми (О-да, о-да, о-да, о-да)
Какво те прави щастлива??
O, пиши ми (О-да, о-да, о-да, о-да)

Всяка една твоя снимка
Искам да я има до възглавницата си, о-о-о, скъпа
Ела и бъди моя учителка
Научи ме на всичко свързано с теб
Твоето 1, твоето 2

*Слушай, моя, моя любима
Аз летя високо в небето
(С двете си крила, с които ти отдавна ме дари)
Сега, тук е толкова високо
Искам ти да изпълниш очите ми
Да, ти ме превръщаш в момче, изпълнено с любов

**О, бо-бо-боже, о, бо-бо-боже
Накара ме да се извися толкова бързо
Искам да бъда едно цяло с теб
О, бо-бо-боже, о, бо-бо-боже
Караш ме да летя толкова бързо
Малко по малко започвам да го разбирам

***(О-а о-а о-а о-а а-а)

Няма по-силно нещо от любовта
(О-а о-а о-а о-а у-у)
От момче, изпълнено с любов

От момента, в който те срещнах, да
Ти се превърна в целия ми живот, да
Ти си звездата, която превръща обикновеното в необикновено
О, да, от едно до десет, ей-ей, всичко в теб е специално, ей
Нещата, към които проявяваш интерес
Начинът, по който вървиш и говориш
Дори и всички твои малки незначителни навици

Ей, всички казват, че преди съм бил толкова малък
А сега съм се превърнал в герой (О, не)
Аз казвам, че никога не съм вярвал в съдбата (О, не)
Световен мир (Няма начин)
Огромен ред (Няма начин)
Аз просто ще те пазя в безопасност
(Момче, изпълнено с любов)

*Слушай, моя, моя любима
Аз летя високо в небето

Ще бъда искрен с теб
Понякога се чувствах като заклещен на едно място
В издигащото се небе, из разпростиращите се зали
Понякога се молих да избягам
Но твоята болка е моя болка
Когато осъзнах това, аз си дадох обещание
Че с крилата на Икар, с които ти ме дари
Ще полетя не към слънцето, а към теб
(Нека полетя)

О, бо-бо-боже, о, бо-бо-боже
Чаках това цял живот
Искам да бъда едно цяло с теб
О, бо-бо-боже, о, бо-бо-боже
Търсих нещо правилно
Малко по малко започвам да го разбирам

(О-а о-а о-а о-а а-а)
Искам нещо по-силно
(О-а о-а о-а о-а у-у)
От моментна, от моментна любов

Няма по-силно нещо от любовта
(О-а о-а о-а о-а у-у)
От момче, изпълнено с любов

Foreign shit runnin' on diesel, dawg
Playin' with my name, that shit is lethal, dawg (Who you say you was?)
Don Corleone
Trust me, at the top it isn't lonely (Strapped)
Everybody actin' like they know me, dawg
Don't just say you're down, you gotta show me (What you gotta do?)
Bring the clip back empty (It's empty)
You asked to see the boss, so they sent me, dawg (Sent me, dawg)
I just broke her off with a 10-piece, dawg (10-piece, dawg)
That ain't nothin', I'm just bein' friendly, dawg

[Chorus: Drake]
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, lot of Murakami in the hallway (What?)
Got a sticky and I keep it at my dawg's place
Girl, I left your love at Magic, now it's all shade
Still goin' bad on you anyway

[Interlude: Meek Mill]
Woah, woah, ooh, woah
Woah, woah, ah

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I could fit like 80 racks in my Amiris (80 racks)
Me and Drizzy back-to-back, it's gettin' scary (Back-to-back)
If you fuckin' with my opps, just don't come near me (Get outta my way)
Put some bands all on your head like Jason Terry (Brrt, brrt, ooh)
Richard Mille cost a Lambo (That's a Lambo)
Known to keep the baddest bitches on commando (Salute)
Every time I'm in my trap, I move like Rambo (Extended)
Ain't a neighborhood in Philly that I can't go (That's a Fendi)
For real
She said, "Oh, you rich rich?" ("You rich rich")
Bitch, I graduated, call me "Big Fish" (Marlin)
I got Lori Harvey on my wish list (That's Lori)
That's the only thing I want for Christmas (True story, uh)
I've been had my way out here, yeah, know that's facts (Facts)
You ain't livin' that shit you say, yeah, we know that's cap (That's cap)
You ain't got to ask me when you see me, know I'm strapped (Brrt)

[Intro: Roddy Ricch]
(Hit-Boy)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I was ridin' ’round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I was riding ’round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
We was lurking on 'em, ain't show no mercy on 'em
We was goin' back to back, we put a curfew on 'em
It was dark clouds on us, but that was perfect for us
We know you always crash and burn, but it was working for us
Limo tint the V-12, double check the details
Gotta cross my T’s and dot my I’s or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the day I dropped my presale
Hold up, let the beat build
See me in the streets still
I been fightin’ battles up a steep hill
They gave my road dog twelve, it was a sweet deal
And I been ridin' solo tryna rebuild
Look

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I was riding 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin’ up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, under no condition would you ever catch me slippin'
Motorcaded shooters plus the Maybach chauffeur driven
If they catch me wit' it, gon' send me off to prison
Judge ain't sympathizin', court don't show forgiveness
Engine in the Lambo drownin' out the music
Silk Dior with the flowers, five gold Cubans
Champagne while I shop, hope I splurge foolish
Closin' Escrow twice this month, both commercial units
Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here
How you die thirty somethin' after banging all them years?
Grammy-nominated, in the sauna sheddin' tears
All this money, power, fame and I can't make you reappear
But I don't wipe 'em though
We just embrace the only life we know
If it was me, I would tell you, "Nigga, live your life and grow"
I'd tell you, "Finish what we started, reach them heights, you know?
And gas the V-12 to the pipe and smoke"

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Another million dollar bail, that's just some regular shit
See my granny on a jet, some shit I'll never forget
Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects
We break bread, we ain't new to success
Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect
Look, just like money know money, nigga, shooters respect
Other shooters we was both, don't want my crew on your neck
I'm on the freeway in a drop, it got me losing my breath
I do the dash with the blues on the deck

[Outro: Roddy Ricch]
Mhmmhm
Mhmmhm
Mhmmhm

==================================================================
[Intro]
We be throwin' money in a spiral
Every time your girl hear my song, yeah, turn her right into my ho
She shake her ass (I'm working on dying), do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Kyro

[Verse 1]
If she left with me, she the right ho
Man, she ridin' me like a BMX
Man, she said the D is for Dyno
I got two horns like a rhino
It's no way you could buy ho
But I bought a mansion with a slide door
Yes, I opened up the slide door so you can hear it hit the high note

[Bridge]
I like the way you (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
Money keep comin' in, I can't lose
Money keep comin' in, I can't lose
Foreign girls and they 10s, I can't choose
Foreign car got V10, I can't cruise

[Chorus]
I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100K, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be riding and my doors suicide

[Verse 2]
Side note, you will never reach my goals (At all)
I be walkin' with a slime nose
And I'm also walkin' with my side ho
Only time I be walkin' when I'm on the moon, so I feel like Michael
I was talkin' to my little slime, that's a lil' lizard, call her Geico
In reality, I'm 5'4"
Stand on my money, now I'm 6'6"
Hit her once, now she dismissed
Can't fuck her sister, make her lick dick
Forty-orty make my hip thick
When I see an opp, make the clip hit
Aimin' at his top, boy you need a mop
Man, I'm goin' out with a vengeance
My pants, Raf Simons
My shoes, Rick-Rick
Your girl dipped my tartar sauce so she ate my dick like a fish stick
Hit it raw, yes, I am a dog, I don't do this shit for no image
All my diamonds, they be hittin' hard
Try to play me boy, that's a scrimmage

[Chorus]
I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100K, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be riding and my doors suicide

[Verse 3]
Live it up, you can just go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Got frost on my diamonds, I'm gettin' the cake now
Now stay on your stomach, lil' bitch, when you lay down
Live it up, 'cause you can go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Frost on my diamonds 'cause I got the cake now
When you on your stomach, lil' bitch, better lay down
I'm so up and I can't turn it down
They counted me out, my whole life turned around
Clean up my diamonds, you know I got rinse it
Know my boys comin', you know they mean business
That advance that you waitin' for, already spent it
When I’m on the beat man, you know I'm gon' kill it

[Refrain]
We be throwin' money in a spiral
Every time your girl hear my song, yeah, turn her right into my ho
She shake her ass, do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Kyro

[Chorus]

If you with the squad, I give you my heart, lil' nigga, I mean it
I was fighting some demons, in the field, bitch, I'm deep in
I was raised in the deep end, I know niggas be sinking
Take your bitch and go deep in, but I gave her back, why you tweakin'?
Come around with that rah-rah, we leave you dead on the cement
With the gang, we ain't playing fair
Matter fact, we don't play at all
OG 'Woods in the air
But we bought the Runtz so we smoke it all
Putting on a front, boy, you better fall
We gon' kill 'em dead, we gon' kill 'em all
Might spend a ten when I'm in the mall
I was on the bend with it in my drawers
Hit that smoke and I'm blackin'
Hit that smoke and I black out
If he run, blow his back down
I was gone but I'm back now
These niggas gon' fold, but I never back down
In the school, I was trappin'
In the school, you was class clown

I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me

There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away

I try to hide it, but I know that it's gonna show
Every single night, I find it harder to sleep
'Cause I need you here with me

Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep

==================================================================
[Verse 1]
Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country

[Chorus]
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia, but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

[Verse 2]
We turned the dirt and worked until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
And then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (Yeah)

[Interlude]
(This is God's country)
God's country

[Bridge]
I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pine wood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country)
Yeah, I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

[Verse 1]
Don't even want the attention
But yeah, that's all that she's getting
Her song is on and she's spinning around, yeah
She got me drunk like Corona
Heart racing like it's Daytona
Ooh, I'm in Heaven, I swear, right now

[Pre-Chorus]
And those eyes can hypnotize
Was designed to blow my mind

[Chorus]
Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

[Verse 2]
It's like I heard angels singing
Like she came down from the ceiling
When she walked in here this evening, I thought, yeah
That girl one in seven billion
Got everyone in here feeling
Like there's a fire in this building, so hot

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a smile on her angel face
I know I'll never lose my faith

[Chorus]
Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

[Bridge]
Got that look in her eyes
Swear she fell right out the sky
Yeah, I think I've seen the light
Every kiss, I could die
It's like the heavens opened wide
Man, I swear I've seen the light

[Chorus]
Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, look what God gave her (Look what God gave her)
Ooh, ooh
Oh yeah, look what God gave her

[Intro]
Oh, this the one right here, Wicked?
Okay
Yeah, yeah
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 1]
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

[Verse 2]
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 3]
Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Tradução de "SOS" por Avicii & Aloe Blacc]

[Verso 1]
Você pode me ouvir? SOS
Me ajude a descansar minha mente
Duas vezes claro, de novo estou agindo baixo
Um quilo de erva e um saco de pancada

[Refrão]
Eu posso sentir seu amor me puxando do subterrâneo
E eu não preciso das minhas drogas
Nós poderíamos ser mais que só amantes de meio período
Eu posso sentir seu toque me pegando do subsolo
E eu não preciso das minhas drogas
Nós poderíamos ser mais que só amantes de meio período

[Pós-Refrão]
Nós poderíamos ser mais que só amantes de meio período
Nós poderíamos ser mais que só amantes de meio período

[Verso 2]
Eu sou roubado de todo o meu sono
Assim que meus pensamentos começam a sair
Eu deixo estar, mas não sei como
Sim, eu não sei como, mas preciso agora

[Refrão]
Eu posso sentir seu amor me puxando do subterrâneo
E eu não preciso das minhas drogas
Nós poderíamos ser mais que só amantes de meio período
Eu posso sentir seu toque me pegando do subsolo
E eu não preciso das minhas drogas
Nós poderíamos ser mais que só amantes de meio período

[Pós-Refrão]
Nós poderíamos ser mais que só amantes de meio período
Nós poderíamos ser mais que só amantes de meio período

[Saída]

BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA!
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Jennie]
천사 같은 "hi" 끝엔 악마 같은 "bye"
매번 미칠듯한 high 뒤엔 뱉어야 하는 price
이건 답이 없는 test
매번 속더라도 yes
딱한 감정의 노예
얼어 죽을 사랑해, eh

[Verse 2: Lisa]
Here I come kickin' the door, uh
가장 독한 걸로 줘, uh
뻔하디 뻔한 그 love, love
더 내놔봐 give me some more
알아서 매달려 벼랑 끝에
한마디면 또 like 헤벌레 해
그 따뜻한 떨림이 새빨간 설렘이
마치 heaven 같겠지만
You might not get in it

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo & Rosé]
Look at me, look at you
누가 더 아플까
You smart 누가 you are
두 눈에 피눈물 흐르게 된다면
So sorry 누가 you are
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 두 눈을 가린 채
사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

[Chorus: All, Lisa, Jennie]
Let's kill this love!
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

Feelin' like a sinner
It's so fire with him I go boo, hoo
He said "you look crazy"
Thank you, baby
I owe it all to you
Got me all messed up
His love is my favorite
But you plus me
Sadly can be dangerous

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé & Jisoo]
Lucky me, lucky you
결국엔 거짓말 we lie
So what? So what?
만약에 내가 널 지우게
된다면 so sorry
I'm not sorry
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 눈물을 감춘 채, eh
사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

[Chorus: All, Lisa, Jennie]
Let's kill this love!
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

[Bridge: Rosé]
We all commit to love
That makes you cry, oh oh
We're all making love
That kills you inside, yeah

[Outro: All]
We must kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Before it kills you too
Kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Gotta kill, let's kill this love!

[Intro]
JD On Tha Track
Iceberg want a bag, bitch

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it’s gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I’m sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don’t get banged
’Cause they'll do the job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 1: Polo G]
She don’t like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it’s Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang that's gon' only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down, better tighten' up yo' shoe lace
Lil bro get up close let the Glock 22 spray

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do the job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 2: Lil TJay]
Oh-ohh-ohh, yeah
I call lil' bro, he said he ready for the stain (Said he ready for the stain)
What you claim? You a lame, you ain't never put in pain (Put in pain)
I be around some killers that go crazy for the gang (They go crazy for the game)
If I showed you all my charges, you won't look at me the same (You won't look at me the same)
Made some choices in my life I wish I never had to make (Wish I never had to make)
Lost my brother, seen him die and I just seen him graduate (I just seen him graduate)
Got that .40 on my side and I'm just rollin' past the jakes (I'm just rollin' past jakes)
Both my hands can do the job and I ain't talkin' masturbate
I was in and outta state (State) 'cause I had a bag to make (Bag to make)
I risked my life but it's aight 'cause God ain't let me pass away (Pass away)
Fuck tomorrow, spin the block, just know we comin' back today (Back today)
I call Polo, he come dolo, we get 'em the fast way

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do the job for me while I hop on a plane

[Intro: Nick Jonas]
I'm feeling so cool
From top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Well, dammit, I'm feelin' so cool, yeah

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old school scene
I'm feelin' high like a late night summer of last year (Yeah)
Standin' there with the red dress on ya
A Killer Queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me or am I just havin' a good year?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like, ooh (Ooh), maybe I should bottle my moves (Moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (Two)
Dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Cool)

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Must've done something right 'cause all these
Lights are green, man, they look like palm trees
And every time that song comes on it's about me
Oh, I feel like Post Malone when I get home
Sittin' there, winning like it's Game of Thrones
And now that we've made it, how complicated was last year?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like, ooh (Ooh), maybe I should bottle my moves (Moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (Two)
'Cause dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Cool)

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Cool, cool, cool
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old school scene
When I grow up, I wanna be just like me

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers]
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like, ooh (Ooh), maybe I should bottle my moves (Moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (Two)
'Cause dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Cool)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Cool

[Intro]
Yeah (Oogie Mane, he killed it)
We tear it up, tear it up, tear it up
(I'm workin' on dying)
Yeah

[Chorus]
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Let's go)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack, rack)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack)
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap (Water)
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Woah)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Fact, fact)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (A fact)
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap (A fuckin' fact)

[Verse 1]
Fendi knapsack, while I'm spittin' Fendi facts (Facts)
I don't want you back, you a thot, you a nat (A fuckin' nat)
Just like his bitch ass, that fuck nigga will get clapped (Will get clapped)
Put a pause on that, you still broke, you ain't back (Yeah)

[Chorus]
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rackie)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rackie)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rackie)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack

[Verse 2]
I could never change, gotta stick to my routine
I'ma hit it once, then you know I gotta leave
Got addictive personality, I turned into a fiend
Okay, my money sky blue, but my new coupe is slime green
My boys whip work 'til the white turn all tan (Tan)
Saw a minivan followin' my brand new Lamb' (Lamb')
I had a F and an N in my hand (And an N)
All my bitches tens, no, I do not fuck no fans
I was checkin' my DMs, found out she was a man (No, no, no)
I can't DM, never, ever again (No)
Lucien on my vision, that's the only thing that's tran (Yeah)
Okay, okay, nigga, let's get it
Got your bitch on my top just like a fitted (Let's get it)
I don't want it no more, then I gotta clip it
Balmain jeans, on the front got the zipper
My ice game got cold, got sicker
I'm a Leo like lion, I'm Simba
Stand on my money, I'm tall like a center
June and July cold just like December
It's too low, then the car, I lift it
I know baby girl miss my drip, yeah
Girl, your breath stink, need a spearmint, many (Yeah)
You need to go and take a minute
But your ass fat, lemme go for the finish
Overseas, I'm eatin' croissants
Told a fuck nigga, "Don't touch my crumpet" (No)
She a lil' thot, can't wife no bird
Four years, I ain't touch no chick

[Chorus]
Whip back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back (Yeah)
Bentley, Hellcat, new Lambo and Maybach (Yeah)
I can't talk on the phone, think my shit is tapped (Hello?)
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Wrap)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rackie)
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap (Lap)
Fendi knapsack, while I'm spittin' Fendi facts (Facts)

[Verse 3]
I don't want you back, you a thot, you a nat (Nat, nat)
Yes, that's them racks, that's them racks, that's them racks (Racks, racks)
Your jeans, they too fat, man, them shits, they relaxed
I got on Dior, and my skinnies, they all black
If we serve the sack, then we take that shit right back (Back, back)
650 for a hat, 6666 hundred for a jacket
Tried to hold me tight, but I didn't hug her back (No way)
'Cause she tried to snatch out my pocket with the racks (These racks)

[Chorus]
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Let's go)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack, rack)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack)
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap (Water)
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Go)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack, rack)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (That's a fact)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Facts)

[Verse 1]
Hotels are made for two night stays, checking in and out
Meeting strangers in the lobby
Waking up and leaving town the next day
But love ain't
And whiskey's poured for when you're bored
And alone on Friday night
When you want to lose yourself
And need a place to hide from all the pain
But love ain't

[Chorus]
Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

[Verse 2]
Sad movies are for crying on the couch there in the dark
That sad song it was written just to try and get your heart to break
But love ain't

[Chorus]
Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

[Bridge]
(Love ain't)
I wonder what he's doing
(Love ain't)
Feeling like a fool
(And you can't)
Keep letting him do it to you

[Chorus]
'Cause love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't
Love ain't (Love ain't), oh yeah (Love ain't)
Love ain't
==================================================================
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle & Belly]
Double up
Three or four times, I ain't tellin no lies, I just run it up
Never let a hard time humble us
Do-do-double up
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just (yeah)
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just
Five, four, three two
That's time, I got, to you
That money, my dreams, come true
My life, in diamonds, who knew?
Who knew? Who knew?

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Turned 7 to a 14
14 to a whole thing
Lord knows it's a cold game
Switched up on you hoes, mayne
Big body take both lanes
Backseat blowin' propane
All black, five gold chains
Young rich nigga bossed up on his own mayne
My new shit sound like it's "Soul Train"
Tookie Williams over Coltrane
Eric B by the rope chain
RSC, we fo' sho bang
Tiny locs and they go crazy
What you know about the dope game?
Was you born in the 80's? Did your mama smoke cocaine?
Have you ever seen a whole thang?
What you drove through to the streets cause you grew up on short change?
Fucked up when the dope age
It remind me when these rappers drop duds and they clothes change
Had the part with the low fade
I would stand in front of Nix wit my sack for the whole day
Drive-by's, that was road rage
Then we park and hop out, learn levels to this whole thang
Old school play the O'Jays
Tryna make a slow change, mama still slavin' for a low wage
Tryna

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle & Belly]
Double up
Three or four times, I ain't tellin no lies, I just run it up
Never let a hard time humble us
Do-do-double up
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just (yeah)
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just
Five, four, three two
That's time, I got, to you
That money, my dreams, come true
My life, in diamonds, who knew?
Who knew? Who knew?

[Post-Chorus: Belly & Dom Kennedy]
I leave it behind if you let me
I probably got drowned just to hold you down
I'd jump off the ledge if you with me
I'd break you up, you just let me down
Let me down
Got my All Money In chain too
Let me down

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
It's hard to catch what you can't see
I grew up to be who I wanna be, so
The more niggas talk I'ma shine
Might a been way before its time
Posted wit my back against the wall
Life is a bitch but she mine
The rag six deuce yeah it's mine
"The Westside II", yeah it's mine
What you know about
Your poster on the wall like the dealership?
Leave her in the bed, legs tremblin'
Gettin' banged on for your Pendleton's
What you know about
Your response be the reason you exist?
Lucky I ain't get caught up in the twist
Young nigga, blue pager on my hip so
As the champagne spill
And the car accelerate and the beat gon' cry
I be goin' to the bank at least three, four times
Getting handshakes from the branch managers
We keep doing fly shit when the cameras cut

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle & Belly]
Double up
Three or four times, I ain't tellin no lies, I just run it up
Never let a hard time humble us
Do-do-double up
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just (yeah)
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just
Five, four, three two
That's time, I got, to you
That money, my dreams, come true
My life, in diamonds, who knew?
Who knew? Who knew?

[Post-Chorus: Belly]
I leave it behind if you let me
I probably got drowned just to hold you down
I'd jump off the ledge if you with me
I'd break you up, you just let me down
Let me down
Let me down
==================================================================
[Intro]
Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you

[Verse 1]
Honestly, this party's over
Everyone here shoulda gone home
But I'm afraid of being sober
'Cause the first thing I do when I'm alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I start touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do?
So I squeeze out the lime on the ice of my drink
And the juice hits the cuts on my fingers
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you

[Chorus]
Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But somethings you can't undo
And one of them's you

[Verse 2]
I'm afraid to turn the lights on
I don't want to face this rebound
Is it weird if I come over?
I want to, but I know that she's around

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'm touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do? (Haha)
Oh, I'm hungry and wasted and my hands are shaking
I shouldn't be cooking, be spilling hot water
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you

[Chorus]
Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But somethings you can't undo
And one of them's you

[Bridge]
Been through every emotion
Right now, I'm sad and broken
Like the bottles on the floor, but I'm too buzzed to clean 'em up
Wish I could get a little un-drunk
So I could, I could un-love you

[Chorus]
Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But somethings you can't undo
And one of them's you

[Outro]
You, you
Wish I could un-love you, you
You, you
Wish I could un-call you, you
You, you
Wish I could un-fuck you, you
Wish I could un-love you

[Intro]
Tell me...
LilJuMadeDisBeat!

[Verse 1]
Ay, big ole freak, big booty, big ole treat
I'ma make him wait for the pussy
Hit it, then he big ole skeet (Baow, baow, baow)
Feet on the bed, I'll fuck him up in the head
Suck it, then look in his eyes
Then, the next day, I might leave him on read (Mwah)
Pop it, pop it, daydreaming 'bout how I rock it
He hit my phone with a horse
So I know that mean come over and ride it
Shid, I'm on the way, ride on that dick, I'm like 'Ye (Hey!)
Usually I like to fuck
But tonight, we gone make love cause you bae
Nobody know, I fuck with him on the low
We never show up together
But I text him when I'm ready to go
Ay, I had a couple of shots at the bar
I'm finna play with that dick in the car
I got him swervin' and breakin' the law
These windows tinted so nobody saw

[Bridge]
Ain't nobody freak like me (Huh)
Give ya what you need like me (Huh)
Ain't nobody got up on they tip-tip toes
Then rode to the tip like me (Huh)
I got him addicted, he fiendin'
My body a drug and he need it
He beggin' me for the treatment
He throw a fit when I leave him

[Chorus]
He like "baby lemme rub, lemme rub on ya
Can I get a lil love, lil love from ya?"
My body addictive, it's driving him crazy
I think I gotta run from ya
Don't know what to do without it
He fuckin' with you? I doubt it
They don't understand that I'm all in his head
And there's nothin' to do about it

[Hook]
You been fiendin' for me lately, going brazy, brazy
I got what you need, I'm gon' give it to you baby
Goin' brazy, brazy, fiendin' for me lately
I got what you need, I'ma give you what you craving

[Verse 2]
See, I'm a big ole freak, I love to talk my shit
And you must be a pussy boy, if you get offended
Bitch it's Tina Snow, they love me 'cause I'm cold
And you can't take no nigga from me, I got mind control
I wanna fuck in the mirror
I like to look at your face when you in it
Come in the room and I'm givin' commands
I am the captain and he the lieutenant
I need that neck like a muhfuckin pendant
Need you to spit, make that muhfucka glisten
Tell him "Shut up!" make that muhfucka listen
I bet he gon' like it, he won't do no trippin'

[Bridge]
Ain't nobody freak like me (Hell nah)
Give ya what you need like me (Hell nah)
Ain't nobody got up on they tip-tip toes
Then rode to the tip like me (Huh)
I got him addicted, he feenin'
My body a drug and he need it
He beggin' me for the treatment
He throw a fit when I leave him (Aah)

[Chorus]
"Baby lemme rub, lemme rub on ya
Can I get a lil love, lil love from ya?"
My body addictive, it's driving him crazy
I think I gotta run from ya
Don't know what to do without it
He fuckin' with you? I doubt it
They don't understand that I'm all in his head
And there's nothin' to do about it

[Hook]
You been fiendin' for me lately, going brazy, brazy
I got what you need, I'm gon' give it to you baby
Goin' brazy, brazy (Ooh, ooh)
Fiendin' for me lately (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
I got what you need, I'ma give you what you craving

[Outro]
Tell me, is it love, is it love again? Oo-ooh

[Verse 1: Khalid]
Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus: Khalid]
All the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Verse 2: Kane Brown]
Saturday nights, your works shoes are stilettos
Smell of cheap perfume
Makeup on your face, try to hide the pain
All the lies, they look like the truth
Deep in your heart, all you want is love
But you never felt good enough
You got wrapped up in other plans
But this ain't the way the story ends

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus: Khalid & Kane Brown]
All the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Bridge: Khalid & Kane Brown]
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
'Cause I care (I care), I care about you
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
There's nowhere I'd rather be than right here around you
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
I care (I care), care about you (Care about you)
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
There's nowhere I'd rather be

[Chorus: Kane Brown, Kane Brown & Khalid,]
With all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care about you the way that I do, oh
All the things that I know that your parents don't
Don't care about you the way that I, the way that I do
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
The way that I do (Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
The way that I do (Do-do-do)
The way that I do (Do-do-do, ah)
The way that I do, I do, oh (Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
She's like a picture from an airplane window
It's always sunny up above the clouds
She's got a mouth full of innuendo
But she makes it sound innocent somehow
Those hungry eyes can't eat the night
Take me to church, show me the light
Straight masterpiece, way out of my league
Yeah but I'm gonna hold her like a trophy tonight

[Chorus]
She's decoratin' my car
Soon she'll be breakin' my heart
She's too Wild Horses to be all mine
I'll be your Beast of Burden on Borrowed Time
She's gonna rip off ay kind of label
She's into leavin' those strings untied
Keepin' it tax free, under the table
She might only be mine tonight
But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt, but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I ain't gonna sit here and overthink it
I got a tiger by the tail
I'll just smile when she sinks her teeth in
She'll leave a scar and a story to tell

[Chorus]
She's decoratin' my car
Soon she'll be breakin' my heart
She's too Wild Horses to be all mine
I'll be your Beast of Burden on Borrowed Time
She's gonna rip off ay kind of label
She's into leavin' those strings untied
Keepin' it tax free, under the table
She might only be mine tonight
But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt, but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away

[Bridge]
Hey hey, hey hey
She's gonna sting me but damn it I want it
Hey hey, hey hey
Honey's so sweet in that moment

[Chorus]
She's decoratin' my car
Soon she'll be breakin' my heart
She's too Wild Horses to be all mine
I'll be your Beast of Burden on Borrowed Time
She's gonna rip off ay kind of label
She's into leavin' those strings untied
Keepin' it tax free, under the table
She might only be mine tonight
But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt, but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away

[Outro]

Yeah, yeah, yeah
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
Hey hey, yeah
Hey hey, yeah

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Last time that I checked, it was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked, I was sellin' zones in the set
Make a quarter mill no sweat
Last time that I checked, I'm the street's voice out west
Legendary self-made progress
Last time that I checked, first get the money then respect
Then the power, and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
I been self-made from the dribble
I was been sayin' I'ma kill em, look
Playin' no games with you niggas
Pop clutch, switch lanes on you niggas, look
I laid down the game for you niggas
Taught you how to charge more than what they paid for you niggas
Own the whole thing for you niggas
Re-invest, double up then explained for you niggas
It gotta be love, who run the city? It gotta be cuz
This for the pieces I took off the Monopoly board
And ya'll niggas false claims, it gotta be fraud
Just keep the hood up out your mouth and you gotta be charged
I doubled up, tripled up, nigga what?
Banged on the whole game, I ain't give a fuck
Nobody trippin', had no business, got my digits up
And when I drop, you know I'm 'bout to fuck the city up

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Last time that I checked, it was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked, I was sellin' zones in the set
Make a quarter mill no sweat
Last time that I checked, I'm the street's voice out west
Legendary self-made progress
Last time that I checked, first get the money then respect
Then the power, and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
And I come through fly (check) no co-sign
I ain't need radio to do mine, I done fine
And I take my time (check) and take my tribe
Every level that I crossed in this game like state lines
It was visionary, either I'm genius or you niggas scary
Maybe it's both and this balance I deliver daily
For every nigga in the streets tryna feed the babies
The single mama's workin' hard not to miss a payment
And dirty money get washed on royalty statements
Black owners in this game of powerful racists
Young niggas in the set that's doin' it makeshift
Out the garage is how you end up in charge
It's how you end up in penthouses, end up in cars
It's how you start off a curb server, end up a boss
It's how you win the whole thing and lift up a cigar
With sweat drippin' down your face 'cause the mission was hard

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Last time that I checked, it was 5 chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked, I was sellin' zones in the set
Make a quarter mill no sweat
Last time that I checked, I'm the street's voice out west
Legendary self-made progress
Last time that I checked, first get the money then respect
Then the power, and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked

[Verse 3: YG]
Last time that I checked, I got the front end and the back
We on the way and that's a fact
This real, this ain't rap, where everybody wanna act pro-black
(They don't really wanna fuck with us) The last lie you heard, this ain't that
This that, "I done made it out the gutter" shit
Nip told you "Fuck the middle man", I told you "Fuck a bitch"
Fuck wearin' their clothes, I wear my own shit
Ya'll can own ya'll label, I own my own, bitch!
Aye Nip, I remember all that game you taught me
Don't fuck around and get played by these label owners
Talk that shit to these niggas, Adrien Broner
But secure the win though, don't let that game fold you
Cause when this game over, it's really game over
And all they do is play the game 'til this game over
And you be givin' game like a big brother
Mission, never let 'em take it from us

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Last time that I checked, it was 5 chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked, I was sellin' zones in the set
Make a quarter mill no sweat
Last time that I checked, I'm the street's voice out west
Legendary self-made progress
Last time that I checked, first get the money then respect
Then the power, and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked

[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

[Verse 1: Lauv]
Party, trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think that they make anything that strong, so I hold on
I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on
I, I, oh I
Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound
Buzz cut season like you're still around
Can't unmiss you and I need you now
Yeah, I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv & Troye Sivan]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
I'm so tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love songs (Someone take me home)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home ('Cause I can't be alone)
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs ('Cause I'm so tired)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

[Verse 1: V]
내가 날 눈치챘던 순간
떠나야만 했어
난 찾아내야 했어
All day all night

[Verse 2: Jimin]
사막과 바다들을 건너
넓고 넓은 세계를
헤매어 다녔어
Baby I

[Refrain: Jungkook]
I could make it better
I could hold you tighter
그 먼 길 위에서
Oh you’re the light

[Verse 4: V]
초대받지 못한
환영받지 못한
나를 알아줬던 단 한 사람

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
끝도 보이지 않던 영원의 밤
내게 아침을 선물한 건 너야
이제 그 손 내가 잡아도 될까
Oh oh
I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Verse 5: J-Hope]
이 세상 속에 영웅이 된 나
나를 찾는 큰 환호와
내 손, 트로피와 금빛 마이크
All day, everywhere
But 모든 게 너에게 닿기 위함인 걸
내 여정의 답인 걸
널 찾기 위해 노래해
Baby to you

[Verse 6: RM]
전보다 조금 더 커진 키에
좀 더 단단해진 목소리에
모든 건 네게 돌아가기 위해
이제 너라는 지도를 활짝 펼칠게
My rehab
날 봐 왜 못 알아봐
남들의 아우성 따위 나 듣고 싶지 않아
너의 향기는 여전히 나를 꿰뚫어 무너뜨려
되돌아가자 그때로

[Refrain: Jin]
Baby I know
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
그 모든 길은 널
향한 거야

[Verse 7: Jimin]
다 소용없었어
너 아닌 다른 건
그때처럼 날 어루만져줘

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
끝도 보이지 않던 영원의 밤
내게 아침을 선물한 건 너야
이제 그 손 내가 잡아도 될까
Oh oh
I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Bridge: Suga]
여전히 아름다운 너
그날의 그때처럼 말없이 그냥 날 안아줘
지옥에서 내가 살아 남은 건
날 위했던 게 아닌 되려 너를 위한 거란 걸
안다면 주저 말고 please save my life
너 없이 헤쳐왔던 사막 위는 목말라
그러니 어서 빨리 날 잡아줘
너 없는 바다는 결국 사막과 같을 거란 걸 알아

[Refrain: Jimin, Jungkook]
All right
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
Oh I can make it right

[Outro: V, Jimin]
다 소용없었어
너 아닌 다른 건
Oh I can make it right

[Jungkook, Jimin, V]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Verse 1: Alec Benjamin]
This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

[Pre-Chorus: Alec Benjamin]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus: Alec Benjamin]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
I hold on to little pieces of what we were
I know we're long gone, but take it easy
Because it hurts

[Pre-Chorus: Alessia Cara]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a girl with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus: Alessia Cara]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Bridge: Alec Benjamin & Alessia Cara]
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

[Chorus: Alec Benjamin & Alessia Cara, Alec Benjamin]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
==================================================================
[Verse 1]
All the boats I've missed
All the hell I've caused
All the lips I've kissed
All the love I've lost
I got kicked around
I've been black and blue
On my way to you

[Verse 2]
All the stars I've seen
All the songs I've sung
All the beers I've drank
All the damage done
I was just passin' time
Kinda just passin' through
On my way to you

[Chorus]
Every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile

[Verse 3]
I got the radio up
Sun is going down
I’ll take a left at the bank
And I’ll head straight through town
So baby, put on that dress
A little sweet perfume
‘Cause I’m on my way to you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Yeah, every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile

[Verse 4]
All the boats I’ve missed
All the hell I’ve caused
All the lips I’ve kissed
All the love I’ve lost
I thank God for that
I guess he always knew
I was on my way to you

[Outro]
On my way to you
On my way to you
